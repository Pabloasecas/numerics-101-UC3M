# numerics-101-UC3M

This repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks designed to introduce students to basic programming and mathematical-computing tools that are useful in Engineering. The materials cover a range of topics including vectors and matrices, plotting techniques, numerical differentiation, initial and boundary value problems, and vector calculus. These tools serve as a foundation for more advanced topics in fluid mechanics, optimization, and numerical methods.

## Notebooks

1. **Intro_vectors_and_matrices.ipynb**  
   An introduction to vectors and matrices, laying the foundation for linear algebra applications.

2. **Plotting_Basics.ipynb**  
   A guide to basic plotting techniques using Python's Matplotlib, helping you visualize data and mathematical functions.

3. **Numerical_differentiation.ipynb**  
   Covers methods to approximate derivatives numerically, a key concept in engineering analysis.

4. **Initial_value_problems.ipynb**  
   Introduces methods for solving initial value problems (IVPs) for differential equations using Python.

5. **Boundary_value_problems.ipynb**   
   Explores numerical methods for solving boundary value problems (BVPs).

6. **Differential_eigenvalue_problems.ipynb**  
   (WIP)

7. **Evolution_problems.ipynb**  
   (WIP)

8. **Vector_calculus.ipynb**  
   Demonstrates various vector calculus identities and theorems (such as Gaussâ€™ theorem and the fundamental theorem for line integrals) with practical Python examples.

9. **Root_finding.ipynb**  
   (WIP)
